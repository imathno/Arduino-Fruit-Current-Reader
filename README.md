# Arduino-Fruit-Current-Reader

A project for my chemistry class that reads fruit voltage via an Arduino Uno.

## Arduino Setup
```
1. Deploy the arduino sketch to the arduino.

2. In the code setup the port name you're using.
Plug in blue and yellow wires to the arduino in pin A0 and one in ground.

3. Have the anode and cathode I used copper and zinc connected to the blue and yellow wires.

4. From the reading if you're getting 0.00 that means you need to swap the wires in either the pins or the anode and cathode.
```
